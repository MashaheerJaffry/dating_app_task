# dating_app_task
Instruction:
Type the following command in the terminal to run the app
1: flutter clean
2: flutter pub get
3: flutter run

In this task the user can create account using phone number user can be set profile picture and set other user information and user can also filter profiles on the basis of weight, age and also gets the user near you. 
In the figma file user is not able to set field such as weight, age where as in the filter screen there are more things to set in that screen according to figma.
So I set the weight and age as random. 

If user is not getting the OPT code then there is a possibility that per day quota of OTP will be reached other way to test that authentication is by setting as testing user phone number.

Every Module of this app that is being integrated doesn't have any major bug and the app is properly working.
